<h3 align="center">Create React App Template - made by <a href="https://github.com/fleflis">Fleflis</a> </h3>

## 📝 A simple CRA template, with powerful settings ready to use

This project was made to get some tedious work done, like installing and setting ESLint, prettier and so on. <br /> Its purpose is to create a project ready to code a web app, scalable and clean, enforcing code style, and a lot more, on the most convenient way. 😄

## 👨🏻‍💻 How to install

As simple as one command. Its just a react app template, so, you can get everything below by typing in terminal with `yarn`:

```shell
yarn create react-app [project-name] --template fleflis-ts
```

or, if you prefer `npm`:

```shell
npx create-react-app [project-name] --template fleflis-ts
```

and finally, just open the project folder with

```shell
code [project-name]
```

and start right away! 😄
